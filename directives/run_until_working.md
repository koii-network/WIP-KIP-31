# Directive: Run Until Working

## Context
This directive was issued to ensure the Bitcoin mining test environment is fully operational and functioning as expected.

## Action Items
1. Start the test environment
2. Monitor logs and metrics
3. Fix any issues that arise
4. Verify all components are working
5. Document any changes or fixes

## Success Criteria
- Bitcoin Core running in regtest mode
- CPU miner actively mining
- Metrics being collected
- API endpoints responding
- No critical errors in logs

## Implementation Steps
1. Start the environment
2. Monitor initial startup
3. Check each component
4. Fix any issues
5. Verify functionality
6. Document results

## Monitoring Points
- Container status
- Bitcoin Core logs
- Miner performance
- API responses
- Metrics collection
- Resource usage

## Required Fixes
Document any fixes needed to achieve working state:
1. [ ] Initial setup issues
2. [ ] Configuration problems
3. [ ] Performance optimizations
4. [ ] Monitoring improvements
5. [ ] Documentation updates
