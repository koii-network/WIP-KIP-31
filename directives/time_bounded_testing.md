# Directive: Time-Bounded Testing

## Context
This directive was issued to ensure testing is efficient and results are obtained within a reasonable timeframe, with proper container health monitoring.

## Action Items
1. Implement container health check endpoint
2. Add timeout mechanism for tests
3. Set up automated success reporting
4. Monitor container logs for issues
5. Implement quick-fail mechanisms

## Success Criteria
- Container reports success within 5 minutes
- Health checks pass consistently
- Logs show expected behavior
- No critical errors during startup
- Metrics collection working

## Implementation Steps
1. Add health check endpoint
2. Implement timeout mechanism
3. Set up success reporting
4. Monitor container logs
5. Implement quick-fail checks

## Monitoring Points
- Container startup time
- Health check responses
- Error logs
- Resource usage
- Test completion status

## Time Limits
- Maximum test duration: 5 minutes
- Health check interval: 15 seconds
- Startup timeout: 2 minutes
- Log check interval: 30 seconds

## Required Changes
1. [ ] Add health check endpoint
2. [ ] Implement timeout mechanism
3. [ ] Set up success reporting
4. [ ] Add quick-fail checks
5. [ ] Update monitoring configuration
