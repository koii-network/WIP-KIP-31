# Mining Pools on Koii Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of Bitcoin mining pools using Koii nodes via Orca tasks, with reward distribution on K2. The system will leverage Koii's Gradual Consensus model for secure and fair reward distribution.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Components
- **Orca Task Container**: Docker container running Bitcoin mining client
- **Share Collection System**: Off-chain database for storing mining shares
- **K2 Integration**: Native program for reward distribution
- **Bitcoin Wallet**: Initially single-sig, later upgraded to 2-of-3 multisig

### 2. Workflow
1. **Work Phase**: Nodes run Bitcoin miners producing shares
2. **Submission Phase**: Shares written to off-chain DB with CID generation
3. **Audit Phase**: Nodes verify share validity
4. **Distribution Phase**: Rewards distributed via K2 task contract

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Feasibility Study
- [ ] Prototype Docker container with Bitcoin mining
- [ ] Test local share collection
- [ ] Validate mining performance metrics

### Phase 1: Orca Task Development
- [ ] Fork Orca template
- [ ] Implement required endpoints:
  - `/task/:roundNumber`
  - `/submission/:roundNumber`
  - `/audit`
  - `/healthz`
- [ ] Local Docker testing and validation

### Phase 2: K2 Integration
- [ ] Develop custom native program for BTC wrapping
- [ ] Implement distribution logic
- [ ] Test K2 token minting and distribution

### Phase 3: Wallet & Payout System
- [ ] Implement single-sig wallet integration
- [ ] Develop reward collection mechanism
- [ ] Create K2 token wrapping process
- [ ] Upgrade to 2-of-3 multisig wallet

### Phase 4: Scaling & Governance
- [ ] Implement share-chain (P2Pool) integration
- [ ] Define operator registration process
- [ ] Establish governance model
- [ ] Develop monitoring and reporting tools

### Phase 5: PoS Staking Integration (Future)
- [ ] Design staking aggregator Orca task
- [ ] Implement liquid staking token issuance
- [ ] Develop collateral management system

## Technical Specifications

### Docker Container Requirements
- Base image with Bitcoin client and miner binary
- Web server on port 8080

## Security Considerations
1. Initial single-sig wallet implementation
2. Migration to 2-of-3 multisig
3. Share validation and audit process
4. Secure key management
5. Network security measures

## Testing & Validation
- Local mining tests
- Share collection validation
- Reward distribution testing
- Security audits
- Performance benchmarking

## Timeline
- Phase 0: 2 weeks
- Phase 1: 4 weeks
- Phase 2: 3 weeks
- Phase 3: 4 weeks
- Phase 4: 6 weeks
- Phase 5: TBD

## Success Metrics
1. Mining efficiency
2. Share collection accuracy
3. Reward distribution fairness
4. System uptime
5. Security incident rate

## Future Enhancements
1. Support for additional PoW currencies
2. Advanced staking mechanisms
3. Enhanced governance features
4. Performance optimizations
5. Additional security measures
