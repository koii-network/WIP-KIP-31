# Bitcoin Mining Pools on Koii Implementation Progress Report

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates the implementation progress of the Bitcoin mining pools on Koii implementation plan across all phases. The project is progressing through its defined phases with varying degrees of completion.

## Phase 0: Feasibility Study

**Status: COMPLETE**

Phase 0 has been successfully implemented with a working prototype that includes:

- Docker container with Bitcoin mining capabilities
- Test environment with Bitcoin Core in regtest mode
- Share collection system using SQLite database
- Monitoring and metrics collection via Prometheus
- Health check endpoints for system status

The implementation demonstrates the feasibility of running Bitcoin mining operations within Docker containers and collecting shares. The code includes proper error handling, logging, and resource monitoring.

## Phase 1: Orca Task Development

**Status: COMPLETE**

Phase 1 has been fully implemented with a working Orca task that includes:

- Implementation of all required endpoints:
  - `/task/:roundNumber` for mining parameters
  - `/submission/:roundNumber` for share submission
  - `/audit` for viewing mining statistics
  - `/healthz` for service health monitoring
- SQLite database for share storage with proper schema
- Docker-based deployment with docker-compose
- Prometheus metrics integration for monitoring
- Comprehensive API documentation

The implementation follows best practices for a Koii Orca task and includes all the necessary components for deployment on the Koii network.

## Phase 2: K2 Integration

**Status: PARTIAL**

Phase 2 is partially implemented with:

- Framework for a BTC wrapper program that can:
  - Connect to Bitcoin Core via RPC
  - Interface with K2 network via Web3
  - Handle key management with encryption
  - Create placeholder functions for:
    - Wrapping Bitcoin rewards
    - Creating Bitcoin transactions
    - Waiting for confirmations
    - Minting K2 tokens
    - Distributing rewards

Current limitations:
- Implementation is largely placeholders without actual Bitcoin/K2 transaction logic
- Configuration files are defined but implementation details are missing
- Token minting logic is not fully implemented
- No testing framework is in place

## Phase 3: Wallet & Payout System

**Status: NOT STARTED**

No implementation work has begun on:
- Single-sig wallet integration
- Reward collection mechanism
- K2 token wrapping process
- Multisig wallet upgrade

## Phase 4: Scaling & Governance

**Status: NOT STARTED**

No implementation work has begun on:
- Share-chain (P2Pool) integration
- Operator registration process
- Governance model
- Monitoring and reporting tools

## Phase 5: PoS Staking Integration

**Status: NOT STARTED**

No implementation work has begun on:
- Staking aggregator Orca task
- Liquid staking token issuance
- Collateral management system

## Recommendations

1. **Complete Phase 2**: Finish the actual implementation of the BTC wrapper with real transaction handling, token minting logic, and proper testing.

2. **Begin Phase 3**: Start implementing the wallet integration and payout system to complement the mining and distribution components.

3. **Documentation**: Add more comprehensive documentation for developers, especially for Phase 2's K2 integration.

4. **Testing**: Develop more extensive testing frameworks for all components, especially for the critical BTC wrapping and token minting functions.

5. **Security Review**: Conduct a security review of the implemented components, particularly the key management system in Phase 2.

## Timeline Update

Based on current progress:
- Phase 0: Completed
- Phase 1: Completed
- Phase 2: 40% complete, estimated 2 more weeks needed
- Phase 3: Not started, original estimate: 4 weeks
- Phase 4: Not started, original estimate: 6 weeks
- Phase 5: Not started, timeline TBD

Total estimated time to completion (excluding Phase 5): 12 weeks
