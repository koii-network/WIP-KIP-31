# Phase 0: Feasibility Study Plan

## Objective
Validate the technical feasibility of running Bitcoin mining operations within Koii's Orca task framework, focusing on share collection and basic mining performance.

## Test Environment Setup

### 1. Docker Container Development
- [ ] Create base Docker image with:
  - Bitcoin Core client
  - CPU miner (cpuminer)
  - Python/Node.js web server
  - SQLite for share storage
- [ ] Configure container to expose:
  - Mining statistics endpoint
  - Share submission endpoint
  - Health check endpoint

### 2. Local Testing Environment
- [ ] Set up test Bitcoin network
  - Regtest mode configuration
  - Custom difficulty settings
  - Test wallet creation
- [ ] Configure mining parameters
  - Adjustable difficulty
  - Share submission frequency
  - Memory usage limits

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Basic Mining Operations
- [ ] Test CPU mining performance
  - Hash rate measurements
  - CPU utilization
  - Memory usage
- [ ] Validate share generation
  - Share difficulty calculation
  - Share submission format
  - Share validation logic

### 2. Share Collection System
- [ ] Test share storage
  - SQLite database performance
  - Share query efficiency
  - Data persistence
- [ ] Validate share submission
  - HTTP endpoint performance
  - Data integrity checks
  - Error handling

### 3. Resource Monitoring
- [ ] CPU usage tracking
- [ ] Memory consumption monitoring
- [ ] Network bandwidth usage
- [ ] Storage I/O patterns

## Success Criteria
1. Mining container runs stably for 24+ hours
2. Share collection system maintains 99.9% data integrity
3. CPU utilization stays within acceptable limits
4. Memory usage remains stable
5. Share submission latency < 100ms

## Testing Tools
1. Prometheus for metrics collection
2. Grafana for visualization
3. Custom logging system
4. Bitcoin testnet tools
5. Performance monitoring scripts

## Timeline
- Day 1-2: Environment setup
- Day 3-4: Basic mining tests
- Day 5-6: Share collection tests
- Day 7: Performance optimization
- Day 8-9: Extended stability testing
- Day 10: Final report and recommendations

## Deliverables
1. Docker container configuration
2. Performance metrics dashboard
3. Share collection system prototype
4. Test results documentation
5. Recommendations for Phase 1

## Risk Mitigation
1. Regular backups of test data
2. Resource usage alerts
3. Automated test suite
4. Emergency stop procedures
5. Performance degradation monitoring
