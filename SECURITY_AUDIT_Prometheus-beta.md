## Security Vulnerabilities

### [1] RPC Security Exposure
_Potential Risk: Unauthorized Network Access_

**Affected Files**: 
- Potential Bitcoin configuration files

**Vulnerability Details**:
- Unrestricted RPC access
- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Potential network exposure

**Code Example**:
```conf
rpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0
rpcpassword=btcpassword
```

**Recommended Fix**:
- Implement strict IP whitelisting
- Use strong, randomly generated passwords
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Use environment-based credential management

### [2] Shell Injection Risks
_Potential Risk: Command Execution Vulnerabilities_

**Affected Files**:
- `/phase-1.5/deploy.sh`
- `/phase-1.5/start.sh`
- `/phase-1.5/backup.sh`

**Vulnerability Details**:
- Potential command injection vulnerabilities
- Lack of input sanitization
- Direct shell command executions

**Code Example**:
```bash
sudo systemctl start $APP_NAME
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER $APP_DIR
```

**Recommended Fix**:
- Use `subprocess` module with `shell=False`
- Implement strict input validation
- Use absolute file paths
- Add input sanitization functions

## Dependency Risks

### [3] Vulnerable Package Versions
_Potential Risk: Known Security Vulnerabilities_

**Affected Files**: 
- `requirements.txt`
- `phase-1/requirements.txt`
- `phase-1.5/requirements.txt`

**Detected Packages**:
- flask==3.1.0
- prometheus-client==0.21.1
- psutil==7.0.0
- requests==2.32.3

**Recommended Fix**:
- Conduct regular dependency audits
- Use `safety` or `dependabot` for automated scanning
- Pin exact, secure versions of dependencies
- Implement continuous security monitoring

## Configuration Exposure

### [4] Sensitive Configuration in Plain Text
_Potential Risk: Credential Leakage_

**Affected Files**:
- `.env` in `phase-1.5/`
- Potential configuration files

**Vulnerability Details**:
- Sensitive credentials stored in plain text
- Risk of unauthorized access
- Potential version control exposure

**Recommended Fix**:
- Use secure secret management systems
- Implement encryption for sensitive configurations
- Utilize cloud secret managers
- Never commit secrets to version control

## Operational Risks

### [5] Insufficient Error Handling and Logging
_Potential Risk: Reduced System Observability_

**Vulnerability Details**:
- Minimal comprehensive logging
- Lack of robust error handling
- No clear circuit breakers
- Potential resource exhaustion

**Recommended Fix**:
- Implement structured logging
- Create comprehensive error handling mechanisms
- Add resource consumption monitoring
- Develop circuit breaker patterns

## Architectural Recommendations

1. **Input Validation**
   - Implement comprehensive input validation
   - Use type checking and schema validation

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Decouple system components
   - Improve modularity and testability

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clearly define component responsibilities
   - Minimize interdependencies

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Implement detailed logging
   - Add performance and security monitoring

5. **Exception Handling**
   - Create granular exception management
   - Provide meaningful error responses

## Compliance Considerations

- Clarify legal jurisdiction for mining operations
- Ensure transparent reward distribution
- Maintain blockchain network compliance
