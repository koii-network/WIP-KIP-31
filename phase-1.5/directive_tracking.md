# Directive Tracking

## Core Directive
Follow the modular testing approach outlined in test_plan.md, ensuring:
- Each test category is implemented independently
- Tests are properly documented
- Coverage is maintained
- Results are reproducible

## Progress Tracking

### Database Component Tests
- [x] DB-01: Database Initialization
- [x] DB-02: Data Operations
- [x] DB-03: Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] DB-04: Error Handling

### API Endpoint Tests
- [ ] API-01: Health Check
- [ ] API-02: Share Submission
- [ ] API-03: Metrics Collection
- [ ] API-04: Error Responses

### Metrics Collection Tests
- [ ] MET-01: Share Rate
- [ ] MET-02: Difficulty Tracking
- [ ] MET-03: Worker Performance
- [ ] MET-04: System Health

### Service Management Tests
- [ ] SVC-01: Startup/Shutdown
- [ ] SVC-02: Configuration
- [ ] SVC-03: Logging
- [ ] SVC-04: Recovery

### Security Tests
- [ ] SEC-01: Input Validation
- [ ] SEC-02: Access Control
- [ ] SEC-03: Data Protection
- [ ] SEC-04: Rate Limiting

## Current Focus
- Implementing Error Handling Tests (DB-04)
- Maintaining documentation standards
- Ensuring test isolation and reproducibility

## Next Steps
1. Create test_error_handling.py for database error scenarios
2. Implement test fixtures for error conditions
3. Add documentation for error handling methodology
4. Set up continuous integration for automated testing

## Success Criteria Checks
- [x] Tests are modular and independent
- [x] Each test has clear documentation
- [x] Test results are reproducible
- [x] Coverage metrics are maintained
- [x] Performance benchmarks are established
- [ ] Security tests are implemented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is operational

## Notes
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Document all test cases
- Follow the implementation order strictly
- Maintain test coverage requirements
